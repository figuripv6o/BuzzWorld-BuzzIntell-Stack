Each layer has a single responsibility.
No layer assumes authority it cannot justify.
SEOeraye (Separated by Design)
SEOeraye is a dedicated feedback-control subsystem focused on search and content performance signals.
It:
observes performance metrics,
compares them to declared intent,
applies bounded, incremental adjustments,
and reports outcomes transparently.
SEOeraye does not:
scrape identities,
impersonate humans,
override platform rules,
or act outside declared limits.
It behaves like a specialist teammate, not a replacement.

Closing Note
BuzzIntell is not trying to be a person.
It is trying to behave like a good colleague.

shows up prepared,
knows its role,
respects the room,
and helps the work get done.
