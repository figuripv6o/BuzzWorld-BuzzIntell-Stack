(with separate SEOeraye subsystem)
Overview
BuzzIntell is a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) stack designed to help complex, multi-platform environments adapt calmly, transparently, and collaboratively.
This repository defines:
how intent becomes structure,
how structure becomes bounded execution,
and how intelligence supports people and platforms without replacing them.
BuzzIntell is not a monolith.
It is a collection of well-behaved subsystems, each with a job to do.
Design Philosophy
BuzzIntell is built on a simple premise:
Complex systems work best when they behave like good teams —
clear roles, bounded authority, visible feedback, and shared goals.
Key principles:
Subsystem-first architecture (nothing does everything)
Explicit interfaces (ports, contracts, metrics)
Bounded control loops (no runaway optimization)
Transparent telemetry (decisions can be inspected)
Human-aligned operation (systems assist, not replace)
This stack is designed to enter platforms respectfully,
not to dominate or subsume them.
